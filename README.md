# swiftlint

Tiny [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) wrapper for npm.

Different from the [Homebrew version](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation) in that it can be installed on Windows. Invocations of `swiftlint` on Windows simply print a warning and pass.

## Install

```
npm install -g swiftlint
```
